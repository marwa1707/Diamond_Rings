High Pressure High Temperature Treatment (HPHT)

The invention of the High Pressure High Treatment (HPHT) process dates to the 1990s when scientists, experimenting with ways to permanently alter the color of some gem quality diamonds, created a complex treatment process that, in its simplest form, is a way of taking high clarity lower color diamonds and transitioning them into more eye-pleasing gems ranging from pink to blue, green, yellowish-green, yellow and colorless.

HPHT Diamond Facts:
· HPHT is permanent.
· The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that HPHT be disclosed.
· Most HPHT diamonds weigh over 1/2 carat.
· HPHT diamonds should cost less than similar natural untreated diamonds having the same grade.
· Gemological Institute of America (GIA) grading reports now indicate when HPHT treatments are detected by stating ""HPHT Annealed"" or ""Artificially Irradiated"" in the Origins portion of a report.","SOLD ON MAY 5, 2010 FOR: $31,900.00"

Robert Whiteside (1950 - 2006)
Robert Whiteside was an American born artist whose talents knew no bounds. A trained musician, painter, sculptor, acclaimed chef, pilot, gifted jeweler and businessman; he is perhaps most well known for his re-creations of Fabergé eggs. His art has been showcased and collected worldwide, including works granted as Gifts of State during the Reagan Administration.

In 1995, Robert Whiteside moved his Dallas based studio to East Texas where he had purchased a farm, which he later turned into a Bed and Breakfast called the Veranda.
Robert Whiteside was not only an artist, but a humanitarian. He participated in community awareness support and services, set up a music foundation, contributed to AIDS fundraisers, and donated his talents to the Crystal Charity Ball in 1987, creating a Fabergé-inspired table setting in conjunction with Gump's.

His life was cut tragically short on October 30, 2006 when he was murdered by a former employee.","SOLD ON APR 29, 2013 FOR: $30,000.00"
